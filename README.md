React Responsive Website

This website is a replica of a mix of websites that I have seen on the web and tried recreating it.

React Hooks (useState and useEffect) and Router was used for this project. First time working with transitions and using videos for the Hero section. It is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, laptop and monitor use
